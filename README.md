# Introduction to Serverless
"Worry about servers, less."
That's the promise of serverless. There are still servers involved, but you don't have to worry about them as much. You can focus on writing code that delivers value for you and your business.

Common aspects of serverless are:

Pay as you go
Automatic scaling
Event-driven (for serverless compute)
These aspects make it very attractive for both small and large organizations to move to serverless.

The Azure cloud contains many services which are considered serverless. There's serverless storage, such as CosmosDB and Blob Storage, and there's serverless compute services such as Azure Functions and Logic Apps.
