# Introduction to Serverless
"Worry about servers, less."
That's the promise of serverless. There are still servers involved, but you don't have to worry about them as much. You can focus on writing code that delivers value for you and your business.

A serverless computing doesnâ€™t mean no server. The code still runs on a server, but you donâ€™t need to care as much about the underlying infrastructure because a third-party service like a Cloud provider will handle it for you. This leads to less time in operations and more time for developing software.

Serverless typically follows a pay-per-execution model, which means you have to pay only when your code runs. This can result in huge cost savings. Serverless also typically provide automatic scaling in real-time based on the computing resources need.

Common aspects of serverless are:

1. Pay as you go
2. Automatic scaling
3. Event-driven (for serverless compute)

These aspects make it very attractive for both small and large organizations to move to serverless.

The Azure cloud contains many services which are considered serverless. There's serverless storage, such as CosmosDB and Blob Storage, and there's serverless compute services such as Azure Functions and Logic Apps.


# Azure Functions
Azure Functions is an event-driven serverless compute platform in the Azure cloud. It integrates seamlessly with many other Azure services through triggers and bindings.
